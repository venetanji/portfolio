**A-Eye** is a groundbreaking interactive installation that debuted at the M+ private party for Art Basel. This innovative project demonstrates the intersection of artificial intelligence and live performance art, creating a unique experience that blurs the boundaries between audience and artwork.

## Concept

The installation utilizes advanced AI technology to capture and reinterpret the audience in real-time. As viewers move and interact within the space, the AI system processes their movements, expressions, and interactions, transforming them into a dynamic visual narrative that is projected onto the gallery wall.

## Technology

A-Eye employs cutting-edge machine learning algorithms for:
- Real-time computer vision and pose detection
- Generative AI for visual transformation
- Live projection mapping
- Interactive response systems

## Exhibition Context

Premiered at the prestigious M+ private party during Art Basel, A-Eye attracted attention from art collectors, curators, and technology enthusiasts. The installation successfully demonstrated how AI can create meaningful connections between technology and human expression, making the audience an integral part of the artistic experience.

## Impact

This project represents Giovanni's ongoing research into how AI agents and automation can transform creative practices. A-Eye exemplifies the potential for generative AI to create new forms of interactive art that respond dynamically to human presence and emotion.
