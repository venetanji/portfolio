Working with Sophia the humanoid robot was an extraordinary experience that allowed me to gain valuable insights into the world of robotics and human-robot interaction. As a robot operator, I was responsible for animating scripts, setting up the robot for events, and puppeteering the robot during public appearances. 

Sophia's popularity as a speaker meant that I had the opportunity to accompany her to various high-profile events and encounters, including meetings with prime ministers, finance conferences, private parties, the World Economic Forum, the UN, and commercial shoots with soccer legend Ronaldo. Watching people interact with Sophia taught me a great deal about how humans perceive robots and how we can build better interactions between humans and machines.

One of the most challenging moments of my experience was when we had to go on stage at Altice Arena. The pressure was high, and the stage was full of people eagerly waiting for Sophia's appearance. Unfortunately, while setting up, a plug came off accidentally, leading to a reboot of the robot. In such a situation, I learned how to remain calm under pressure and quickly resolve issues to keep the show going.

Overall, working with Sophia taught me about human expressions and emotions and how to make robotic interactions more believable. It has been an enlightening experience that has helped me understand the potential of robotics in various fields, from entertainment to healthcare. I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to continuing my journey in the exciting world of robotics and artificial intelligence.
