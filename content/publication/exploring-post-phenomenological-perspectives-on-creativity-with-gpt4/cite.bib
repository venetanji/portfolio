abstract="This paper explores the use of post-phenomenology, a contemporary philosophical movement, as a framework  for understanding the relationship between humans, technology, and creativity. The theory of mediation proposed by Don Ihde is employed to categorize different types of technological relations that shape creative contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to generate post-phenomenological descriptions of arbitrary examples of technology. The generated formalizations can be evaluated and refined theoretically, contributing to the evaluation of the theoryâ€™s applicability to various creative scenarios. This remedial attitude in proceeding emerges as a methodological bridge between computational creativity and design. Furthermore, reflecting on this process of inquiry highlights the inherent creative potential of LLMs and their application in exploratory practices."
