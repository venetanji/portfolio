abstract: This pictorial investigates how overlooked personal habits and
  machine-learning biases in photo-imaging practices can be identified through
  the image-generative capabilities of a GAN algorithm. Incorporating a
  designerly way of reflecting is key to noticing such habits and biases. These
  are therefore revealed both by noticing what the algorithm is capable of, yet
  also the relationship between humans and the world which this technology
  mediates. Practices of photo-taking and photo-looking facilitate this process
  of reflection. Simultaneously, the technology provides a window into its
  functioning and its potential integration into on-site image-taking practices.
